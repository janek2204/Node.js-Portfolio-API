    about_me:
      "Graduated from the General Assembly full time Software Engineering Immersive course. I’m looking to apply my new programming skillset to better customer experience through reliable, effective and bug free code whilst solving customer problems and meeting their needs. I’m looking to contribute to the business success by supporting the build of systems and customer experiences to ensure business delivers on its value proposition. I love gadgets and technology - innovative everyday gadgets, finding new ways to automate tasks and new technology trends. I like to spend my free time exercising, running and cooking. One of my biggest passion are escape rooms - offline and online problem solving and traveling (not much recently, unfortunately).",
