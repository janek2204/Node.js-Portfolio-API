      "The GA SEI course was a full time immersive course that included over 400 hours of professional study and a further 400+ hours of practical coding over a 12 week period. During the course, I have gained knowledge of front-end and back-end technologies and can now create real-world working web applications. I have developed a passion for clean code, new technologies and an enthusiasm for solving both real world and technical problems. While studying at GA, I have worked on multiple projects independently and in a pair/group coding scenario.",
