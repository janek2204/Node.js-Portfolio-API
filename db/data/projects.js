      "Space Invaders is a classic arcade game from the 80s. The goal of the game is for the player to shoot an invading alien armada before it reaches the planet's surface using a mounted gun turret. For the theme of the game I chose a virus attacking the lab. This was my first project from General Assembly's course. It was an individual project built in 9 days and was the first proper game I had built as well as my first real-world web application with vanilla JavaScript and CSS.",

      "Building Best London Parks was my first experience of building a full-stack, MERN application as part of a group. After a short amount of discussion, we came up with the idea of creating the London parks app, a social app for users to share and review their favorite parks. For the backend, my responsibility was to build all needed routes for our models. For the frontend, I created a design of all parks and home page sections, registering and login users, image upload using Cloudinary.com, user profile page, MapBox, image carousel and add notification blocks using react toastify package.",
